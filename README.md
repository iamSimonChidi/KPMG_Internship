# KPMG_Internship
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes &amp; cycling accessories organization, has given me a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. In this project, data obtained from current customers who have transacted with the company would be used in the determination of our target customers.
The first task I performed was the data quality assessment. This was to ascertain the validity of the data and to check for missing values.
The second task was data insights. This involves targeting high value customers based on customer demographics and attributes. 
The third task was data insights and presentation. This involves using data dashboards, data visualizations and presentations to make recommendations to the Chief Marketing Officer and the CEO.
