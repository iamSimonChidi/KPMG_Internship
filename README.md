# KPMG_Internship
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes &amp; cycling accessories organization, has given me a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. In this project, data obtained from current customers who have transacted with the company would be used in the determination of our target customers.
The first task I performed was the data quality assessment. This was to ascertain the validity of the data and to check for missing values.
The second task was to create an interractive dashboard where metrics that will be used for the determination of new customers would be derived.
The third task was to do a Powerpoint presentation of my findings and recommendations to the Chief Marketing Officer.
